                    <h2>Purpose of study</h2>
                    <p>This research study aims to understand how people with different views on climate change communicate with each other. We are interested in examining the dynamics of cross-ideological conversations and their potential effects on attitudes and understanding.</p>

                    <h2>What to expect</h2>
                    <p>If you choose to participate, you'll first be asked to provide some demographic information. Next, you'll evaluate your views on climate change and the role of human influence. You'll then be paired with another participant who holds a different perspective for a 5-minute text-based conversation. Afterward, you'll complete a short exit survey about your experience.</p>
